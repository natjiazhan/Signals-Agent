  "summary": "The spectral analysis of the audio from a busy street shows dominant low-frequency energy, especially in the 0\u2013100 Hz region, typical of engine rumble and road vibrations from passing vehicles. Occasional mid-frequency bursts suggest additional traffic elements such as horns or even human voices. Overall, the spectral content is consistent with an urban street environment with heavy traffic and diverse sound sources.",
