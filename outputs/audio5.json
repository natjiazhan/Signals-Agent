  "summary": "This audio clip is characterized by a dominant, stable low-frequency signal (0\u20132000 Hz) displaying minimal variability over time. A minor transient boost in the 4000\u20136000 Hz range was observed, but the overall spectral content suggests a synthesized tone likely generated electronically rather than through natural or human sources.",
