  "summary": "This clip contains two AI voices engaging in conversation with clear synthetic speech characteristics. The spectral analysis reveals dominant energy in the mid-frequency range, especially around 266\u2013400 Hz, with additional harmonics up to 2000 Hz. The stable tonal patterns and temporal modulation between peaks align with voices generated via synthesized text-to-speech, creating alternating voice profiles.",
