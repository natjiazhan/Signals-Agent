  "summary": "This audio clip displays spectral features characteristic of classical music. It shows dominant low-frequency energy\u2014with peaks in the bass frequencies likely arising from string instruments such as cellos and double bass\u2014complemented by mid-frequency components corresponding to violins, woodwinds, and pianos. The dynamic distribution over time supports a rich orchestral performance.",
