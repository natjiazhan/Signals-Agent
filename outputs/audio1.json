  "summary": "The audio exhibits a steady, low-frequency hum dominated by energy in the 0\u2013100 Hz range, which gradually decreases up to 2000 Hz. This spectral pattern is characteristic of man-made sources such as electrical transformers, motors, or HVAC systems, rather than transient natural phenomena.",
