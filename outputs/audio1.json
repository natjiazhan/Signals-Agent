  "summary": "This audio clip captures the sound of a tranquil forest stream. The frequency analysis indicates dominant low-frequency energy with resonant tonal qualities, likely produced by water flowing over rocks. The steady zero-crossing rate, smooth autocorrelation, and consistent amplitude envelope all point to a continuous, natural water flow, while the low spectral flatness and fractal dimension suggest that the water is resonating with natural features. Overall, the audio is consistent with a peaceful, natural forest stream.",
