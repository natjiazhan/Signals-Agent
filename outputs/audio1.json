  "summary": "This audio file, lasting around 20 seconds, is dominated by a sustained low-frequency hum with most energy in the 0\u2013133 Hz band. The signal's steady amplitude, low zero crossing rate, very low spectral flatness, low complexity (as indicated by fractal dimension), and extremely low Shannon entropy point to a highly tonal, machine-like source. These spectral characteristics are typical of electrical or mechanical hums, such as those produced by transformers, HVAC systems, or motors.",
