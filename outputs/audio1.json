  "summary": "This clip was recorded in a forest where a flowing creek dominates the soundscape. The FFT analysis reveals that most of the energy is concentrated in the lower frequencies (0-1102 Hz), typical of natural water flow, with a consistent, stable amplitude over time. Minor energy in higher bands may indicate ambient rustling leaves or distant wildlife, but the primary source is clearly the creek and environmental forest sounds.",
