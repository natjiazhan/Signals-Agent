  "summary": "This 20-second recording exhibits a stable, ambient spectral profile. A dominant low-frequency component below 133 Hz\u2014likely representing a persistent hum from indoor sources such as ventilation or electrical systems\u2014is observed, while higher frequencies show lower, consistent energy. The overall sound is that of a quiet, controlled indoor environment with a continuous background noise rather than sporadic transient events.",
