  "summary": "This recording exhibits continuous low-frequency energy predominantly below 500 Hz with stable amplitude and moderate transient fluctuations. Although the spectral flatness suggests a narrow, tonal quality, this is likely a result of resonant effects produced when water flows over rocks. Combined with the image showing a natural stream with flowing water and rocks, the evidence strongly supports that the primary source of the recording is ambient water flow in a natural stream.",
