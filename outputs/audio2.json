  "summary": "The audio clip, set in a first-person shooter game scene on a yacht, features a dominant, sustained low-frequency tonal ambient sound. This is likely representative of engine hum or synthetic background tones typical of man-made game audio. The signal\u2019s stable periodicity, very low spectral flatness, and structured envelope suggest a synthesized source. A sudden transient in one window, indicated by a high zero-crossing rate, may correspond to a weapon sound or explosion effect.",
