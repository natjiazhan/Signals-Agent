  "summary": "The analysis shows a dominant low-frequency hum (especially below 133 Hz) that is consistent with an elevator motor's operation, along with secondary mechanical sounds suggestive of structural resonances. The overall spectral profile is typical for an elevator environment with minimal high-frequency content.",
