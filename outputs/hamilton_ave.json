  "summary": "The audio clip, recorded in an event space, primarily shows low-frequency energy (0\u20132000 Hz) consistent with human conversations. A noticeable energy increase in the 2000\u20134000 Hz band around 35.55\u201337.42 seconds points to construction or mechanical noise. This analysis reveals a blending of background chatter with intermittent mechanical activity, typical in busy event environments.",
