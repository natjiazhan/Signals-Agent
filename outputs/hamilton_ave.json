  "summary": "This clip predominantly features urban ambient noise with strong, continuous low-frequency energy, consistent with distant traffic or engine hum along Hamilton Avenue. In the final couple of seconds, the reduced low-frequency background and the emergence of transient mid-frequency components indicate a discrete urban sound event, such as a passing vehicle.",
