  "summary": "The analysis of audio12.mp3 reveals that the spectral energy is almost exclusively confined to the 0\u2013200 Hz range, with a consistent rise from around 30 Hz and dominant peaks in the range of 100\u2013140 Hz. This steady and continuous low-frequency tone with harmonic structure strongly indicates a synthesized origin, resembling an electronically generated bass tone.",
