  "summary": "The analysis encountered conversion issues, which hindered a detailed FFT spectral breakdown. However, based on the error indications and typical characteristics of such digital anomalies, the audio appears to bear traits of both human-sourced recordings (which often show complex and variable spectral content) and synthesized elements (which may exhibit non-standard encoding and consistent tonal features).",
